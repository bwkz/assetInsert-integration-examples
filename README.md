# bwkz-integration-examples

This repo contains example code for integrating our POST /assetInsert API call into 3rd party applications such as CMSs, eComm systems, or your custom apps enabling users of those systems to easily select and insert images, videos and documents from Brandworkz into that app.

The examples are for Jquery and ECMAScript6+WebPack.
